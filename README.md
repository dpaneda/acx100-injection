Patched version of acx driver to work with Kernel 3.0 and injection.

I detect some problems when using the driver in monitor mode. Seems to work
just well with normal use. I don't think those problem are related with the
path to make it work with kernel 3.0.

Hope this driver will be useful for someone, feel free to send me any patches
but if you want to have the state of the art of the driver you better check
the official repo of the acx100 driver, because this code is already old and
probably I don't update it because I don't use this driver anymore.
